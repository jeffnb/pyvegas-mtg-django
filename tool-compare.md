# Evaluating AI Dev Tools on Real Tasks

## Objective

We wanted to evaluate how different AI coding tools handle simple but real developer tasks. Using a basic Django repo, we tried the following:

- Add a `.gitignore`  
- Convert the repo to use `uv`  
- Write unit tests  
- Upgrade Django  

We used GitHub Copilot, Claude, Jules, and Junie. Hereâ€™s how each tool actually performed across those tasksâ€”with real links to PRs and an honest breakdown of pros and cons.

## GitHub Copilot

Copilot integrates deeply with GitHub. You can assign issues directly to it, and it will open a pull request and start working in the background. The PR itself becomes a kind of checklist for what itâ€™s doing.

### Add `.gitignore`  
ðŸ”— [PR #5](https://github.com/jeffnb/pyvegas-mtg-django/pull/5)

- It added a `.gitignore` file, but ironically also checked in every `.pyc` file.
- After requesting removal, it fixed the issueâ€”which was nice.
- PR stayed in draft mode, even after changes were reviewed and accepted.

**Pros:**
- Strong PR description
- Testing plan included
- Fits well into standard GitHub review process

**Cons:**
- No checkboxes in the testing plan
- Needed manual prompting to fix `.pyc` file issue
- Never exits draft mode automatically

### Convert to `uv`  
ðŸ”— [PR #10](https://github.com/jeffnb/pyvegas-mtg-django/pull/10)

- Minimal code changes and mostly correct
- Review feedback (like dependency updates) didn't result in any action

**Pros:**
- Super easy to get started
- Detailed PR with usage instructions
- Updates `README`
- Claimed it tested the changes
- You can view Copilotâ€™s reasoning process

**Cons:**
- No pre-PR customizationâ€”all feedback must happen after the draft is created
- Took 7.5 minutes
- Didn't react to feedback about dependencies
- Again, left in draft mode

### Add Testing  
ðŸ”— [PR #15](https://github.com/jeffnb/pyvegas-mtg-django/pull/15)

- Functionally fine. Comparable to Claude.
- Nothing surprising.

**Pros:**
- Explicitly tested admin and URLs
- Used the correct index path
- Included test setup

**Cons:**
- Inconsistent in replying to comments and change requests
- At one point it errored out
- Somehow checked in a DB fileâ€”even though `.gitignore` shouldâ€™ve blocked that

### Upgrade Django  

- Couldnâ€™t use `uv` due to firewall limits, so it defaulted to `pip`
- Didnâ€™t catch the `pyproject.toml` allowing a Python version too low for Django 5.2.3

**Pros:**
- Updated URL settings appropriately
- Fast execution
- Attempted compatibility fixes

**Cons:**
- Skipped over the Python version problem entirely
- Wouldnâ€™t have caught the issue unless `uv` was used

### Bonus: Code Review  

Copilot does this well.

- Inline comments
- Labels nitpicks vs. critical issues
- Feels like a human reviewer

## Claude

Claude requires you to run everything locally. You need GitHub SSH and `gh` CLI configured, but once you're set up, it acts like a developer sitting next to youâ€”very interactive.

### Add `.gitignore`  
ðŸ”— [PR #6](https://github.com/jeffnb/pyvegas-mtg-django/pull/6)

**Pros:**
- Everything happens locallyâ€”easy to see whatâ€™s going on
- Asks for clarification and permission step-by-step
- PR is created in normal (non-draft) mode
- Includes checkbox-style test plan

**Cons:**
- Slower due to back-and-forth interaction
- Doesnâ€™t automatically run tests
- More setup required

### Convert to `uv`  
ðŸ”— [PR #12](https://github.com/jeffnb/pyvegas-mtg-django/pull/12)

**Pros:**
- Fixes its own mistakes when prompted
- PR description is detailed
- Runs `django check` post-change
- Identifies and prunes unnecessary `requirements.txt` entries

**Cons:**
- Didnâ€™t anticipate the production impact of `django-extensions`
- Specified system-dependent Python version
- Takes longer due to interaction

### Add Testing  
ðŸ”— [PR #16](https://github.com/jeffnb/pyvegas-mtg-django/pull/16)

**Pros:**
- Both unit and integration tests
- PR includes good instructions and coverage summary
- Tests cover views, forms, models
- Decent test data generation

**Cons:**
- Includes fluff tests (e.g., simple model creation)
- Some assumptions about routing
- Not very well documented

### Upgrade Django  

**Pros:**
- Upgraded Python version when needed
- Ran tests and checks
- Included test coverage numbers in PR

**Cons:**
- Missed some outdated links in settings
- Several incorrect commands required rerunning

### Bonus: Code Review  
ðŸ”— [PR #19](https://github.com/jeffnb/pyvegas-mtg-django/pull/19)

**Pros:**
- Thorough feedback

**Cons:**
- One large comment block instead of inline comments
- Tone is more critical than collaborative

## Jules

Jules runs entirely in the browser. It boots a VM, asks you to approve a plan, and executes.

### Add `.gitignore`  
ðŸ”— [PR #7](https://github.com/jeffnb/pyvegas-mtg-django/pull/7)

**Pros:**
- Didnâ€™t commit `.pyc` files
- Fast setup and execution

**Cons:**
- Overrode and lost existing config
- Doesnâ€™t always create PRs (sometimes commits directly)

### Convert to `uv`  
ðŸ”— [PR #13](https://github.com/jeffnb/pyvegas-mtg-django/pull/13)

**Pros:**
- Created an `agents.md` fileâ€”interesting touch

**Cons:**
- Missed the task entirely
- Couldnâ€™t parse `README.md` due to case sensitivity
- No `pyproject.toml`
- Didnâ€™t create a PR

## Junie

Junie is like Claude, but integrated into the IDE. You can see terminal output and it offers prompts, but is sometimes too subtle in its feedback.

### Add `.gitignore`  
ðŸ”— [PR #8](https://github.com/jeffnb/pyvegas-mtg-django/pull/8)

**Pros:**
- Terminal is visible
- Can resume where it left off
- Checks for latest GitHub CLI version

**Cons:**
- Minimal PR description
- Authentication errors look like success

### Convert to `uv`  
ðŸ”— [PR #11](https://github.com/jeffnb/pyvegas-mtg-django/pull/11)

**Pros:**
- Clear what it was doing
- PR description is thorough

**Cons:**
- Overengineered shell script
- Added a `.uvignore` file (not supported)
- Missed several steps unless re-prompted

### Add Tests  

**Pros:**
- Broke tests into modules
- Debugged live as it went
- Preemptively switched branches

**Cons:**
- Didnâ€™t use `uv`
- Failed to create PR unless told
- Didnâ€™t pull `main` or push branch remotely

### Upgrade Django  
ðŸ”— [PR #17](https://github.com/jeffnb/pyvegas-mtg-django/pull/17)

**Pros:**
- Tried running server to verify changes
- Updated `pyproject.toml`

**Cons:**
- Didn't release terminal after server run
- Used `pip` instead of `uv`
- Manual dependency editing

## Final Thoughts

Each tool had strengths and tradeoffs:

| Task               | Best Tool | Why                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Add `.gitignore`   | Claude    | Clean, local, interactive, no weird file check-ins   |
| Convert to `uv`    | Copilot   | Fast, mostly correct, useful documentation           |
| Add Tests          | Claude    | More coverage, better debugging loop                 |
| Upgrade Django     | Claude    | Detected Python version issues and ran `uv` properly |
| Code Review        | Copilot   | Inline, contextual, balanced tone                    |
